The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a severe sleep
disorder characterized by frequent upper airway obstruction.
This project presents a simple solution to monitor OSA with
an android application for smartphones that is able to estimate
the percentage and time slots of sleep apnea from a recording
of a subject while he/she is sleeping. Firstly, ten features were designed and 
extracted from time and frequency domain with Matlab, for
classification of normal breathing, snoring and apnea. Then, K-nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented to work as classifier,
which was also trained in Matlab to obtain the most optimal
model. This classifier works together with a database generated
in the study that will be the reference samples to classify. Finally,
the models developed were translated into Java language to be
used in the android application. The Java methods used for the
app development were compared to the ones developed in Matlab
in order to be validated. Lastly, some tests were done in the
application
